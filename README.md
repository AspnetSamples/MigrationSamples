This repository contains ASP.NET Framework samples. This repository is being used for testing purposes only.
If you are creating new ASP.NET applications, we recommend that you use ASP.NET Core instead of ASP.NET Framework like these samples use.

For PartsUnlimited you'll need to install SQLServer Express to get the project running successfully.
